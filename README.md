# Resume

I'm a junior full stack web developer who specialized in the JavaScript MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node). Recently I've been learning React.js. Also a Pythonista! My most up-to-date resume is available here as a pdf, if you want to copy the LaTeX (because you like markup pain), it's a riff off the Deedy template. Have at! (Note: it needs LuaLatex, not just LaTeX).
